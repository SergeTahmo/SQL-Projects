-- Step 1: Remove duplicate employee records

DELETE FROM dedup WHERE rn > 1;

-- Step 2: Standardize date fields
ALTER TABLE hr_employees_cleaned
ALTER COLUMN hire_date DATE;

ALTER TABLE hr_employees_cleaned
ALTER COLUMN termination_date DATE;

-- Step 3: Calculate employee tenure in days
ALTER TABLE hr_employees_cleaned
ADD tenure_days AS

-- Step 4: Categorize employees by department

ALTER TABLE hr_employees_cleaned
ADD employment_status AS
    CASE
        WHEN termination_date IS NULL THEN 'Active'
        ELSE 'Terminated'
    END;

-- Step 6: Calculate monthly headcount by department
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_monthly_headcount AS
SELECT
    YEAR(hire_date) AS year,
    MONTH(hire_date) AS month,
    department_category,
    COUNT(employee_id) AS hires

    department_category,
    COUNT(employee_id) AS terminations

-- Step 8: Employee turnover rate per department per month
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_turnover_rate AS

    h.month,
    h.department_category,
    h.hires,
    t.terminations,

FROM vw_monthly_headcount h
LEFT JOIN vw_monthly_terminations t
    ON h.year = t.year AND h.month = t.month AND h.department_category = t.department_category;

-- Step 9: Average tenure by department
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_avg_tenure AS
SELECT
    department_category,
    AVG(tenure_days) AS avg_tenure_days
FROM hr_employees_cleaned
WHERE employment_status = 'Terminated'
GROUP BY department_category;

-- Step 10: Data quality check - missing key employee info
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_missing_employee_info AS
SELECT employee_id, employee_name
FROM hr_employees_cleaned
WHERE email IS NULL OR phone IS NULL;

-- Step 11: Performance rating distribution
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_performance_distribution AS
