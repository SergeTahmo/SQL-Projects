Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and enriching customer data for RetailCo Inc., a mid-sized retail chain with both online and in-store operations. The final goal is to enable deep customer segmentation and develop a Power BI dashboard for marketing and operations teams.

Project Objective
To transform raw, inconsistent customer records into a clean, analysis-ready dataset that captures high-value behaviors such as purchase frequency, average spend, and churn likelihood.

Dataset Summary
Source: Internal CRM exports (SQL), Point-of-Sale Excel logs, and e-commerce API pulls

Rows: ~12,000
Columns: 15
Key Columns:
customer_id
signup_date
last_purchase_date
total_orders
total_spent
gender, age, region

Data Cleaning Tasks
ðŸ”¸Removed Inactive Accounts
Removed customers who signed up but never made a purchase (where total_orders = 0).


DELETE FROM retail_customers
WHERE total_orders = 0;

ðŸ”¸ Formatted Timestamps
Converted signup_date and last_purchase_date from text to DATE format to enable time-based analytics.

ALTER TABLE retail_customers
ALTER COLUMN signup_date DATE;

ðŸ”¸ Corrected Customer Demographics
Replaced invalid gender values (e.g., "N/A", "U") with NULL.

Corrected age entries > 100 or < 10 by replacing with the median.

ðŸ”¸ Resolved Duplicate Records
Identified and kept only the most recent entry per customer_id.


WITH Ranked AS (
  SELECT *, 
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY last_updated DESC) AS rn
  FROM retail_customers
)
DELETE FROM Ranked WHERE rn > 1;


ðŸ”¸ Handled Missing Transaction Data
For missing total_spent values but known total_orders, imputed using median order value.

Feature Engineering
Created customer_tenure = TODAY - signup_date
Created avg_order_value = total_spent / total_orders
Flagged high_value_customer = TRUE if total_spent > 95th percentile
Created churn_risk_flag if last_purchase_date > 180 days ago

ðŸ“Œ Key SQL Queries
To identify high-value customers by region:


SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS high_value_customers
FROM retail_customers
WHERE total_spent > 1000
GROUP BY region;


Conclusion
This project produced a robust, clean dataset ready for Power BI modeling and helped unlock actionable insights for RetailCoâ€™s marketing team. The cleaned data enabled segmentation, churn prediction, and improved targeting of high-value customers.
